      <h3>Can't Stay - Daniel Rector</h3>

            I recorded this track in the summer of 2014 at an impromptu session in Roanoke, VA.
            The recording was done all in one take, with less than 8 tracks and only 3 musicians.
            The room was a large warehouse, and the copious amounts of empty space were used for reverb.
            The final sound was achieved with minimul use of compression and eq.

      <h3>Fix You - Coldplay (Joseph Tormey Bootleg)</h3>

          This project was mastered by myself for digital distrubution.
          I used minimal band compression and tasteful limiting to push the track hard without clipping or distortion.

      <h3>Push - JP Ford</h3>

          I recorded the vocalist for this project over an instrumental he provided.
          I used stacking techniques with creative compression to bring out his unique voice.
          I was able to blend the track together with more compression/eq and create a polished track.
